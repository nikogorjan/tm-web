    <h3 className='text-medium-normal black'>
        I was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 16, which was probably the hardest period of my adolescence. I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, which is genetic and can trace back up to 10 generations. 
        At the time, it was a huge shock for me, as there weren't many cases of diabetes in Slovenia, and the society’s view of the disease was different from how it is seen now.
        That’s when I decided to make changes in my life and discovered that fitness and a balanced diet have a very positive impact on diabetes.
    </h3>

    <h3 className='text-medium-normal black'>
        I tried various diets on my own, and at first, I went without insulin for a year, managing my blood sugar only through diet. 
        I quickly realized that such a strict diet wasn’t suitable for normal life and proper physical development, and that someone with diabetes needs insulin.
    </h3>

    <h3 className='text-medium-normal black'>
        My diabetes is very well-managed, despite weighing 110kg of muscle mass. 
        I am a firm believer that people with diabetes should eat all foods, but in moderation, and engage in a lot of physical activity, as movement and a balanced diet are the main factors for well-regulated blood sugar.
    </h3>

    <h3 className='text-medium-normal black'>
        I’ve noticed that diabetes is becoming more common among younger people and is now considered a modern disease.
    </h3>

    <h3 className='text-medium-normal black'>
        Since the industry has advanced so much, there are now many products available in stores that are suitable for diabetics, which makes our lives easier.
    </h3>

    <h3 className='text-medium-normal black'>
        Having diabetes or any kind of intolerance doesn’t mean you are limited or need to treat yourself as a patient. You can still fulfill any desire; you just need to change your lifestyle.
